## Ubuntu-Inspired Image Fetcher 

> "I am because we are." – Ubuntu Philosophy  

This project is a simple **Python program** that fetches images from the web in the spirit of **Ubuntu** — community, sharing, and respect.  

The script:
- Prompts the user for an image URL
- Creates a `Fetched_Images` folder (if it doesn’t exist)
- Downloads the image and saves it with a meaningful filename
- Handles errors gracefully

---

## Features
- Uses the `requests` library for HTTP requests  
- Gracefully handles network errors and invalid URLs  
- Organizes downloaded images into `Fetched_Images/`  
- Follows Ubuntu principles: Community, Respect, Sharing
